    Design a 32-bit multiplication program "multiplication.asm", and use assembly language to realize the function of the following C++ instructions. NOTE: variable sizes and program functions should be equivalent to C/C++ instructions. 
    	unsigned int num1 = 300,000; 	// use dd to declare 32-bit variable 
    	unsigned int num2 = 400,000; 	// use dd to declare 32-bit variable 
    	unsigned long product = 0; 	// use dq to declare 64-bit variable 
    	product = long(num1 * num2); 


    Design a 32-bit division program "division.asm", and use assembly language to realize the function of the following C++ instructions. NOTE: variable sizes and program functions should be equivalent to C/C++ instructions. 
    	unsigned long num1 = 50,000,000,000; 	// use dq to declare 64-bit variable 
    	unsigned int num2 = 3,333,333; 	// use dd to declare 32-bit variable 
    	unsigned int quotient = 0, remainder = 0; 	// use dd to declare 32-bit variable 
    	quotient = num1 / num2; 
    	remainder = num1 % num2;
